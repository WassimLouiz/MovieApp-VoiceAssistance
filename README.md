# MovieApp-VoiceAssistance

This web application created with ReactJS for the frontend, APIs and firebase to bring the data for the movie application as well as the ALAN-AI which is a ML model that brings some life into the application, making it more interactive and making the user experience better.

This application shows the actual trending and average rate of each movie as well as a small description with a hover of a the main actors and finally an access to the youtube trailer.

Not only the trending but also all the movies and series that can be filtered as well as a research page.
